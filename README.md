Brief summary of what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?
When keeping the number of the generation large, and did more rounds of evolution, we observe that the genes of those numbers would
converge to 2 particular genes of those states among the whole group, or the genes appear homogenous. There are more variations with a smaller population and vice versa.

Reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?
We think it is interesting to do random simulations. Also, it is interesting to see that the gene converge to similar strcutures as 
groups of creatures only have a little difference in gene. 
We learned copying and slicing and concatenate array lists.
